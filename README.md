# RageLab Studio

RageLab Studio is the desktop visual interface for [RageLab](https://github.com/RageLab/ragelab).

It provides native workspace access, visual inspection, scene rendering, editing workflows, and export UX while keeping RAGE parsing, validation, dependency resolution, and writer safety in the Rust core.

## Architecture

RageLab Studio is a client of RageLab, not a second implementation of RAGE formats.

  Svelte
  Three.js
      |

RageLab
  Rust core

  format readers and writers
```

Frontend code is responsible for presentation and interaction. Binary format knowledge and write eligibility remain in Rust.

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Current status

The repository currently provides the desktop application shell, native workspace directory selection, and a typed frontend/native bridge. Asset indexing and editor surfaces will be connected incrementally to the RageLab core.

## Development

Requirements:

- Rust toolchain
- Bun
- Windows, macOS, or Linux dependencies required by Tauri 2

Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Run frontend checks:

```bash
bun run check
bun run build
```

Run the desktop application:

```bash
bun run tauri dev
```

## Project boundaries

- No RAGE binary parsing in TypeScript.
- No writer safety decisions in the frontend.
- No dependency-resolution logic duplicated from RageLab.
- Source assets are not overwritten implicitly.
- Native filesystem access is exposed through narrow desktop commands.
